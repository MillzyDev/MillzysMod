### Millzy's Mod is an external mod for BONELAB that adds features, weapons and tools from Half-Life 2 and Garry's Mod in to the game.
-----
### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
#### Millzy's Mod will be a Quest-Only release initially - I don't have access to a PC that would be capable of running BONELAB at the moment, nor do I know if BONELAB will feature some form of FPFC. So a PC version of this is on-hold until I get my hands on new hardware.
-----

**Millzy's Mod** runs on-top of [Sc2ad's QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader). You can create your own BONELAB mods like **Millzy's Mod** through the **Millzy's Mod Installer**
