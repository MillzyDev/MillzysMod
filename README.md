### Millzy's Mod is an externally loaded mod for BONELAB that adds features, weapons and tools from Half-Life 2 and Garry's Mod in to the game. It also hosts a few QOL features as well as some utilities for other externally loaded mods to use such as UI.
-----
### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
#### Millzy's Mod will be a Quest-Only release initially - I don't have access to a PC that would be capable of running BONELAB at the moment, nor do I know if BONELAB will feature some form of FPFC. So a PC version of this is on-hold until I get my hands on new hardware.
