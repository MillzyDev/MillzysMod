### Millzy's Mod is an external mod for BONELAB that adds features, weapons and tools from Half-Life 2 and Garry's Mod in to the game.
### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
#### Millzy's Mod will be a Quest-Only release initially - I don't have access to a PC that would be capable of running BONELAB at the moment, nor do I know if BONELAB will feature some form of FPFC. So a PC version of this is on-hold until I get my hands on new hardware.

# Features
Millzy's mod hosts many features that make it similar to Garry's Mod, some of these are weapons others are tools.

## Weapons

### Toolgun
The toolgun is a custom weapon. Unlike the Garry's Mod equivalent, it can not be used to spawn items and NPCs since BONELAB already has a tool for that. However it will still be the primary interface for using [tools](#tools) within the game. It will feature a laser guide for improved accuracy.

### Camera
The camera is a small tool that allows you to take amazing photo's in BONELAB featuring full zoom control and automatically renders the photos to a designated location.

### Gravity Gun
The Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2... not much more other than that.

## Tools
All the tools listed are interfacable using the [Toolgun](#toolgun).

### Weld
Welds two objects together, making them move together as one.

### Easy Weld
Handles welding orientation stuff for you.

### Remover
Destroys an object.

### Duplicator
Creates an asset of selected objects allowing it them to be saved and loaded at will

## API
Millzy's Mod will have a simple API allowing other external mods to interface with it, add their own tools to the [Toolgun](#toolgun) as well as other things. The API for the Quest and PC versions will be different: Quest will be interfaced with using C++, PC will most-likely be interfaced with using C#.
